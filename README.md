Overview of the Project
The *Student Grade Tracker* Python program is designed to help users manage student grades across different subjects or assignments. Here's a high-level overview of its functionality:

*Program Features:*
1. *Input Grades:* 
   - The program allows the user to input multiple grades for different subjects or assignments.
   - The number of subjects or assignments is determined by the user, providing flexibility.

2. *Grade Calculation:*
   - The program calculates the *average grade* based on the grades entered.
   - It uses this average to determine a corresponding *letter grade* (A, B, C, D, or F) and the *GPA* (from 0.0 to 4.0 scale).

3. *Grade Display:*
   - After the calculations, the program outputs the entered grades, the calculated average, the assigned letter grade, and the GPA in a clean, formatted manner.

*Key Components:*
- Grade Input Function:* This takes user input for each subject and its corresponding grade, storing the data in a dictionary.
- Average Calculation:* The program computes the average by summing all grades and dividing by the number of entries.
- Letter Grade and GPA Calculation:* Based on standard grading scales, the program maps average scores to letter grades and their respective GPA values.
- *Results Display:* It prints all relevant information, including the list of grades, average score, letter grade, and GPA.

*Purpose:*
The program helps users (students, teachers, or parents) track academic performance in a simplified, interactive way. It can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as weighted averages or multiple grading systems. 

In essence, it's a basic grade management system that provides a snapshot of a student's academic standing.
